## Installation Architecture

The installation leverages a Docker Compose-based multi-container setup, which provides several benefits:

- **Preconfigured Services**: Most services, including key components like PostgreSQL, Kafka, and RabbitMQ, are pre-configured, reducing the need for manual configuration and setup.
- **Containerized Deployment**: The use of Docker containers ensures a consistent and reproducible deployment environment, simplifying the installation process.

At the heart of the architecture is an Nginx instance, which acts as a router, managing traffic for client-accessible services. This architectural choice offers the following advantages:

### SSL Offloading

Nginx terminates SSL/TLS connections, allowing backend services to operate without the burden of encryption management. This reduces computational overhead and simplifies certificate handling, improving overall system performance and maintainability.

### Load Balancing and Scaling

Nginx distributes client requests across backend services using algorithms such as round-robin or least-connections. This ensures efficient resource utilization and high availability, enabling the system to scale seamlessly as demand increases.

### Request Routing

The advanced configuration capabilities of Nginx, including path-based routing and caching mechanisms, enhance response times and optimize resource usage. This results in a more responsive and efficient system, providing a better user experience.

By leveraging the strengths of Docker Compose and Nginx, the installation architecture establishes a robust, scalable, and easily manageable deployment environment, simplifying the setup process and ensuring the smooth operation of the system.

### Network Security and Isolation

The system uses Docker's networking features to improve security and reduce theapplication’s attack surface. Specifically:All inter-service communication happens only within the Docker network, ensuring noexternal exposure.

Middleware (e.g., PostgreSQL, Kafka, RabbitMQ) and application services are isolatedfrom the public network by default.Only client-accessible services are exposed to reduce the attack surface.This approach ensures that sensitive communications between components are protectedfrom external access, following best practices for containerized application security.
