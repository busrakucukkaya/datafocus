### What is TDM?

Efficiency is the ultimate goal in software testing, and Test Data Management (TDM) tools offer the definitive solution to save time and reduce costs. TDM empowers testing dynamics by seamlessly moving production-level data to different working environments or creating synthetic data. This dynamic process provides a high-level flow of test data for software applications, making the product development lifecycle more efficient.

TDM plays a critical role in addressing the test data requirements of software test teams. This important process guarantees the delivery of error-free test data tailored in quantity, format and environment to meet the diverse needs of development, testing, user acceptance testing and other environments. TDM uses two different methods to accomplish this task.

### Use Cases of TDM

First, if business data is already in use at production level, TDM orchestrates its migration to the targeted environment. This effectively optimizes storage efficiency, involving full-scale database migration or a strategic subset.

Secondly, if data is missing at the production level - a common scenario during the development phase of products not yet released to the market - TDM emerges as a solution. Using rule-based algorithms and leveraging the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models, TDM synthetically generates fully suitable table data from scratch. This innovative process allows for testing insights even in the absence of live data.
